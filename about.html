<h2>Our Story</h2>
	 <p>Open since 2000, we are a specialty coffee chain that provides excellent coffee and a comfortable work environment. Our first cafe opened in St Andrews as a specialty coffee store that is a quiet workspace for students. We have expanded globally, and are constantly on the look out to open in new locations. Our mission is to support the coffee industry and we only supply Fairtrade, organic, and environmentally friendly products. With that in mind if you bring your own coffee cup you get 10p off of every drink. The beans we use are listed below!</p>

	<h3>Colombian Beans</h3>
	<p> Coffee was first introduced to the country of Colombia in the early 1800s. Today Maragogipe, Caturra, Typica|Typica and Bourbon cultivars are grown. When Colombian coffee is freshly roasted it has a bright acidity, is heavy in body and is intensely aromatic. Colombia accounts for about 12% of the coffee market (by value) in the world, third in volume after Vietnam and Brazil. They have the most recognizable coffee flavor to most North Americans</p>

 <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4">

  <h3>Brazilian Beans</h3>
	<p>Why should Brazil stand alone when the rest of the Americas get lumped together in bigger groups? For one thing, the country is a huge producer, and its output varies widely. Some Brazilian beans—especially those that are pulped natural or "Brazil natural"—have a pronounced peanutty quality and heavy body that makes them common components in espresso blends. Chocolate and some spice is typical, and the coffees tend to linger a bit in the mouth, with a less clean aftertaste than other South American regions' stuff.</p>

<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4">
	<img src="beanbag3.jpg" alt="Kenyan Beans" height="300" width="300">
  <h3>Kenyan Beans</h3>
	<p>Big, bold, and juicy, Kenyan coffees are a product of their variety (SL-28 and SL-34 are the most prized), processing (there is a post-fermentation soak that can last a day or longer), and the fact that much of the coffee is grown without shade. These elements (and probably many, many others) marry to give Kenyan coffees a mouth-puckering savory-sweet characteristic that sometimes manifests as a tomato-like acidity, other times a black-currant tartness. There is something almost universally tropical-tasting about good-quality Kenyan coffees, and many coffee professionals will admit that they are a favorite.</p>

  <img src="beanbag4.jpg" alt="Indonesian Beans" height="300" width="300">
	<h3>Indonesian Beans</h3>
	<p>Again we see the result of variety, processing, and climate in the coffees from Indonesia, which tend to have a deep, dark, almost meaty earthiness to them. Sumatran coffees in particular take to dark roasting well, and so there are often smoky and toasted flavors present in the cup. Others will have a stouty or mushroom-like complexity that is both savory and herbaceous, and a long, lasting finish that feels like very dark or unsweetened cocoa.</p>

  <img src="beanbag5.jpg" alt="Sarchimor Beans" height="300" width="300">
	<h3>Sarchimor Beans</h3>
	<p> A hybrid between the Costa Rican Villa Sarchi and the Timor variety. Because of its Timor parent, Sarchimor is quite resistant to leaf rust disease and stem borer. As well as Costa Rica, it is grown in India.</p>
